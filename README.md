# Just Dark Screen Only (but with a clock added)

I have multiple monitors and sometime when I play a game or even watching videos, I find my secondary monitor distracting or even damaging my eyes due to its white background color (Google and such). 

Therefore, I just created this site as a counter to this problem.

Take care of you eyes, everyone.
